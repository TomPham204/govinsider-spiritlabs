    "post_content": "<p style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 18px; padding-left: 40px;\">Hello there, thank you for stopping by. We’re GovInsider, a team of writers, events producers, content marketers and all-round government geeks.\nFor over five years, we have spoken with leaders and change-makers in government, shared their stories with our global audience of 4 million senior civil servants, and put together conferences for public and private sector innovators to discuss the future.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 18px;\">We have interviewed prime ministers, ministers, ambassadors, mayors, agency CEOs, tech chiefs and more. Check out this <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joeescobedo/2017/06/08/reaching-government-decision-makers/#935b1932bd96\">Forbes</a> interview to learn our secret sauce for working with government.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 18px;\">We love bringing good people with good ideas together. That’s why we have partnered with three branches of the United Nations to run summits for innovators around the world to discuss public service delivery in the 21st century. Our events unite the public and private sectors to build relationships, learn from each other, and create solutions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 18px;\">Our flagship summit has been attended by princesses, mayors, ministers, and more than 1,000 senior government officials. We have been named one of the six “key” global events where digital government officials can share their learnings by the Bennett Institute for Public Policy at the University of Cambridge.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-32475\" src=\"https://govinsider.asia/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GIL.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"242\" height=\"105\" /></p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Innovation Labs World 2017</strong></h2>\n[gallery columns=\"5\" ids=\"32580,32589,32585,32588,32587,32586,32584,32583,32582,32581\"]\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Innovation Labs World 2018</strong></h2>\n[gallery columns=\"6\" ids=\"32574,32575,32576,32577,32578,32579\"]\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>GovPay | GovNext 2019</strong></h2>\n[gallery columns=\"5\" ids=\"32566,32567,32568,32572,32573\"]\n<p style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px;\">Scroll and hover through the timeline below to watch how we've grown through the years.</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1PVjP37rqSdYbjvhMJiAYpQ88bNVMjvHwsZcUMJ9Equ0&amp;font=Lustria-Lato&amp;lang=en&amp;start_at_end=true&amp;timenav_position=top&amp;initial_zoom=1&amp;height=650\" width=\"100%\" height=\"650\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">VIRTUAL</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 18px;\">We started a digital video studio in the midst of a pandemic and ran a full week of online discussions, complete with a <a href=\"https://www.festival-of-innovation.com/tour\">virtual reality tour</a> of Singapore’s iconic Gardens by the Bay. 20,000 viewers tuned in for the livestream to celebrate the successes and resilience of nations in the pandemic, and explore the possibilities in digital identity, sustainability and security by design.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 18px;\">That’s not all. We partnered with some of the world’s greatest companies to tackle policy challenges. We’ve worked with global governments to push for climate action. We’ve also danced for the Surabayan mayor at a celebratory dinner after hosting a successful event.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 18px;\">We’re passionate about building up the next generation of leaders. We partner with education institutions, including University College London, the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, and Yale-NUS College, to provide skills and platforms for budding journalists and policy professionals to understand the pressing needs of public service delivery. University College London also named a scholarship programme in our honour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 18px;\">The GovInsider story is always evolving. But for now, we’d love to get to know you better. If you have ideas for working together, do get in touch!</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #94409c;\">To find out more about partnership opportunities, download the GovInsider Prospectus below:</span></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"row\"><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://www.clarion-events-group.com/l/339341/2020-02-17/25mjz7r\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span></iframe></div>",

The use of the term “personal information” does so as CCPA defines it, to mean information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household. However, personal information does not include publicly available, deidentified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in CCPA). Also, the definition of “personal information” does not currently apply to the collection of personal information from job applicants, employees (whether you are our employee or any employee of our customers), business owners, directors, officers, medical staff or contractors.\n\nWhere we act as a “business” under CCPA (meaning we determine the manner and reasons for why we process your personal information), we may be required to disclose additional information regarding the categories of personal information we collect, the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we collect that information, who we share that information with, as well as whether we sell that personal information – all of which depends on the specific service being provided.\n\nDepending on your relationship with us, we may have collected each of the above categories of Personal Information about you. In addition, we may have shared one or more of these categories of Personal Information with third parties during the preceding 12 months for the business purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n<strong>California Residents – How to contact us:</strong>\n\nIf you are a resident of California and are not a job applicant, employee/contractor, or employee/contractor of another company interacting with us in your job role, you have the right to request what category of personal information we collect about you, how we use that personal information, and the categories of third parties we disclose that personal information.\n\nYou also have the right to request that we delete your information.\n\nTo make a request, you can contact us at +1 203 344 7118​ and ask for the US Data Privacy Officer or by email to our Data Privacy Officer at <a href=\"mailto:usprivacy@clarionevents.com\">usprivacy@clarionevents.com</a>\n\nor in writing to: Clarion Events Inc, Attention: Data Privacy Officer, Clarion Events, Inc. Suite 125, 35 Nutmeg Drive, Trumbull, Connecticut, 06611, United States.\n\nPlease provide us enough information to verify your identity. We will use information you provide to us to verify your request. If we cannot initially verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the verification process, such as, for example, a copy of your driver’s license and/or a recent utility or credit card bill.\n\nCalifornia residents also have certain rights regarding the “sale” of “personal information” (as such terms may be defined by CCPA). California residents have the right to opt out of such “sale” of their “personal information” in accordance with CCPA by sending an email to our Data Privacy Officer at <a href=\"mailto:usprivacy@clarionevents.com\">usprivacy@clarionevents.com</a> or in writing to: Clarion Events Inc, Attention: Data Privacy Officer, Clarion Events Inc., Attention: Data Privacy Officer, Clarion Events, Inc.

They can mitigate climate change; improve education; increase living standards; support great startups; assist an ageing population; keep citizens safe; fund vaccines; find new efficiencies and much, much more.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">These solutions will only come about if government officials innovate and test new approaches. We showcase solutions to the many challenges faced by public servants. We look across Asia Pacific for practical examples of governments doing things differently. And we look to the private sector as well; particularly cutting-edge technology companies with new ideas and approaches.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">We hope that you’ll join our community and help us build this platform. Everything that we do will always be free for the public sector. As a first step, why not sign up for our morning briefing? There’s a big button at the top right hand page that will let you do it with just a few keyboard strokes.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">If you have any questions or suggestions, please <a href=\"https://govinsider.asia/the-team/\">contact us</a>.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Thanks for reading,</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Joshua</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;\">Editor, GovInsider</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:20px;\"><a href=\"mailto:Joshua@GovInsider.Asia\">Joshua@GovInsider.Asia</a></p>\n\n</div>",

    "post_content": "In 16th century Europe, people feared Belphegor – the daemon of innovation (pictured left). This prince of Hell cursed people will new inventions, encouraging them to become lazier.\n\nEven in 18th century America, innovation was not judged to be a good thing. President George Washington allegedly warned on his death bed: “Beware of innovation in politics”\n\nThank goodness times have changed. Officials are now constantly told about the importance of being innovative – but what does that mean?\n\nSimply, it means that the challenges facing governments today cannot be tackled by traditional government structures and approaches. There is too much complexity in a globalised world. New technologies are creating massive new expectations for civil servants to meet. And vast amounts of data, combined with computing power, can create a greater focus on evidence when making new policies.\n\nSo governments are creating new units with new approaches to policy making. Singapore has its Strategic Policy Unit and PS21; the UK has the What Works Network; Malaysia has PEMANDU; South Korea has the Seoul Innovation Bureau; Hong Kong has its Efficiency Unit; Jakarta has its Smart Cities Unit. The list is long and exciting. All of these units are piloting new policies and projects that could hugely improve government services.\n\nNew tools are also emerging. Take behavioural economics, a methodology pioneered by the UK’s ‘nudge’ unit. Through small tweaks in forms and processes, government can achieve big results. Tweaking the design of tax forms hugely increased the percentage of people paying their taxes on time (the 16% increase in compliance could equate to billions of dollars).\n\nEqually, government can now pilot projects in exciting new ways – such as Social Impact Bonds being trialled in Australia. Or in some cases, model projects based on predictions of future citizen needs. Certainly, in Singapore, the Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning Programme is doing just that. From drones delivering medicine to semantic analysis of social media, there are a huge number of exciting projects occurring across Asia. GovInsider will be covering them.\n\nBut that is only half of the story. There is also increasing pressure on government to support private sector innovation. Many countries are competing to start the next Silicon Valley. And as the economist Mariana Mazzucato writes, that requires a totally new approach from government. “Getting governments to think big about innovation is not just about throwing more taxpayer money at more activities. It requires fundamentally reconsidering the traditional role of the state in the economy.\n\nSpecifically, that means empowering governments to envision a direction for technological change and invest in that direction. It means abandoning the shortsighted way public spending is usually evaluated. It means ending the practice of insulating the private sector from the public sector. And it means figuring out ways for governments and taxpayers to reap some of the rewards of public investment, instead of just the risks.”\n\nAs officials trial new approaches, from Singapore and Israel’s world-beating venture capital arms to the UK’s network of CATAPULTs, GovInsider will be covering these in detail. And as delivery units use new approaches, such as Malaysia using management techniques pioneered in car factories to transform healthcare, we’ll cover that as well.\n\nBut we need your help.

    "post_content": "In 16th century Europe, people feared Belphegor – the daemon of innovation (pictured left). This prince of Hell cursed people will new inventions, encouraging them to become lazier.\n\nEven in 18th century America, innovation was not judged to be a good thing. President George Washington allegedly warned on his death bed: “Beware of innovation in politics”\n\nThank goodness times have changed. Officials are now constantly told about the importance of being innovative – but what does that mean?\n\nSimply, it means that the challenges facing governments today cannot be tackled by traditional government structures and approaches. There is too much complexity in a globalised world. New technologies are creating massive new expectations for civil servants to meet. And vast amounts of data, combined with computing power, can create a greater focus on evidence when making new policies.\n\nSo governments are creating new units with new approaches to policy making. Singapore has its Strategic Policy Unit and PS21; the UK has the What Works Network; Malaysia has PEMANDU; South Korea has the Seoul Innovation Bureau; Hong Kong has its Efficiency Unit; Jakarta has its Smart Cities Unit. The list is long and exciting. All of these units are piloting new policies and projects that could hugely improve government services.\n\nNew tools are also emerging. Take behavioural economics, a methodology pioneered by the UK’s ‘nudge’ unit. Through small tweaks in forms and processes, government can achieve big results. Tweaking the design of tax forms hugely increased the percentage of people paying their taxes on time (the 16% increase in compliance could equate to billions of dollars).\n\nEqually, government can now pilot projects in exciting new ways – such as Social Impact Bonds being trialled in Australia. Or in some cases, model projects based on predictions of future citizen needs. Certainly, in Singapore, the Risk Assessment and Horizon Scanning Programme is doing just that. From drones delivering medicine to semantic analysis of social media, there are a huge number of exciting projects occurring across Asia. GovInsider will be covering them.\n\nBut that is only half of the story. There is also increasing pressure on government to support private sector innovation. Many countries are competing to start the next Silicon Valley. And as the economist Mariana Mazzucato writes, that requires a totally new approach from government. “Getting governments to think big about innovation is not just about throwing more taxpayer money at more activities. It requires fundamentally reconsidering the traditional role of the state in the economy.\n\nSpecifically, that means empowering governments to envision a direction for technological change and invest in that direction. It means abandoning the shortsighted way public spending is usually evaluated. It means ending the practice of insulating the private sector from the public sector. And it means figuring out ways for governments and taxpayers to reap some of the rewards of public investment, instead of just the risks.”\n\nAs officials trial new approaches, from Singapore and Israel’s world-beating venture capital arms to the UK’s network of CATAPULTs, GovInsider will be covering these in detail. And as delivery units use new approaches, such as Malaysia using management techniques pioneered in car factories to transform healthcare, we’ll cover that as well.\n\nBut we need your help.

    "post_content": "The blizzard of statistics that Idris Jala has at his fingertips tells a story of rapid progress. Little wonder, then, that the walls of his office — located just below the prime minister’s — are adorned with numbers precisely specifying the targets and achievements of the government’s Transformation Programme since its launch in 2010.\n\nIdris Jala was appointed minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and chief executive of Malaysia’s Performance Management and Delivery Unit in 2009. He is responsible for leading the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) and the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), which underpin Malaysia’s efforts to become a developed, high-income nation by 2020.\n\n“It would be hard to find any country in the world that has been so clear about what it set out to do,” he says. “The problem with being so clear, though, is that it shows if we are unable to meet [our goals]. But every year we have an annual report and, if I look back over the past five years, I’m actually very impressed with the work that has been achieved against the targets that were set.”\n\nThe decision by the Prime Minister to launch these twin transformation programmes was prompted by the recognition that a step change in development was needed to safeguard Malaysia’s future prosperity. Although the twinkling lights of Kuala Lumpur’s Petronas Towers are a vivid example of the country’s economic prowess, segments of the country’s population remain excluded.\n\n<strong>The big picture</strong>\n\nThe GTP therefore aims to transform public-service delivery and ensure a high standard of living for all. The ETP is about enabling and unleashing greater private-sector initiative, with the government acting as a facilitator for the planned level of investments.\n\nJala stresses that inclusivity is a clear driver for the reforms. “When we said we wanted to create a new economic model, it couldn’t be something that only provides prosperity to a certain group of people. We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.”\n\n[blockquote] \"We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.” [/blockquote]\n\nSustainability is another focus, with much emphasis placed on avoiding the deep fiscal deficits that continue to plague other countries. “We have been able to reduce our fiscal deficit and have not missed our target in any of the last five years,” Jala says. “A lot of people were concerned about things like off-balance-sheet numbers and other liabilities, but even if these were included, we would still be performing better than many other countries.”\n\nSmall wonder, then, that the IMF recently paid tribute to Malaysia’s progress by lauding its “fiscal policy breakthrough” and the “important institutional innovation” that the country has undertaken.\n\nThe creation of a more balanced economy is crucial, he adds. “A sustainable fiscal position also includes reducing our dependency on oil and gas,” says Jala. “In 2009, oil and gas made up nearly 40% of government revenue. We were able to reduce this to 29 percent last year. How did we do this? We have enabled other sectors to grow. Our services sector, in particular, has grown substantially.” He adds that environmental progress has also been made, citing new investments in public transport and waste management as important, and continuing, priorities for the years ahead.\n\n<strong>How PEMANDU works</strong>\n\nBefore his government service, Jala enjoyed a long career in the private sector, establishing a reputation as someone who could turn around unprofitable businesses. After 21 years at Shell, he became managing director and CEO of Malaysia Airlines in 2005, where he turned a nine-month loss of $400 million into a record profit of $270 million in less than two years. The biggest difference between the public and private sectors, he says, lies in the financial statement. “In the private sector you have profit and loss, cash flow, and balance sheet — all anchor points to determine what constitutes success. In a country, though, it is very difficult, very nebulous — it can be anything you want — and that is why we spend a long time trying to identify what constitutes the measures of success, because if you don’t have this then you can’t prioritise.”\n\nJala’s emphasis on priorities is the key to the government’s new approach to transformation. “It is very important to have a programme — and I repeat the word ‘programme’,” he says. “In Malaysia and in many other countries, we have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes.”\n\nThe second ingredient is a budget. “A plan and a programme are just drafts until you have a budget and resources allocated to them,” he says. “So you should never print a plan that has no detailed budget. In the past, many governments have prepared beautiful plans but they were just drafts because they didn’t come with the requisite resources attached.”\n\n[blockquote] “We have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes” [/blockquote]\n\nThe twin foundations of programmes and budgets enable policymakers to identify their shared priorities, says Jala. “Most governments suffer from the problem of prioritisation. If you ask for their priorities and check how they allocate their resources, then they are often completely flawed. You can check their prioritisation by looking at their budget and whether or not their priorities are getting the lion’s share.”\n\nUnderpinning all of this is leadership alignment. “A cabinet can agree in the room,” he says, “but allocating resources to those priorities is when you find out if they do all really agree. It’s hard going because some ministries will lose resources, but this is when alignment becomes real.\n\nJala says that that this approach “absolutely” applies to private-sector organisations, and he and his government colleagues have adopted a number of different methods, from cabinet awaydays to public town halls, to ensure leadership alignment.\n\nThe awaydays, in particular, have proved very useful, he says. “Every year, we run these events. The prime minister and all the ministers sit down to take stock of where we have done well and where we haven’t. We also have an international panel review. We get people from the IMF and World Bank to come in and give us an outside-in view. We can then identify what we can do better. These meetings can be very brutal and honest and we mark the performance of each minister and ministry … from constructive criticism to commendations, and then we can see our priorities for next year and agree on the resources we need to deliver them.”\n\nIn addition to daily or weekly reviews, there is a semi-annual meeting of ministers, Jala, and the prime minister to check on progress. “And every month, a minister must chair a steering meeting that highlights the monthly achievements and problems,” Jala adds. “If the problems are not solved at the ministerial level, then they get escalated to the twice-yearly meetings chaired by the prime minister. If I lay all these together it shows how we have been able to move to implementation, rather than just having beautiful plans.”\n\nIt is clear that Jala believes prioritisation and budget to be pivotal to transformation as a whole. Many projects fail — not because of incompetence or bureaucracy — but rather from a lack of prioritisation, which can cause them to be poorly funded.\n\n<strong>What’s next?</strong>\n\nThe success of Malaysia’s transformation programme has increasingly attracted global attention. For example, 24 members of Jala’s team have been working in Tanzania to replicate the reforms and are seeing some impressive results. This suggests that the approach can be emulated in different countries. “If you had asked me when we first started if we could have achieved these results by this time, I would have said we probably couldn’t,” he reflects. “The credit goes to everyone who has been involved.”\n\nTo maintain the momentum, he says it is crucial to continue on this path and not be distracted. “We also need to get sharper and better prioritisation in allocation of resources. Life is full of trade-offs. Every government has to understand that it cannot do everything under the sun — you have to pick your battles and areas of priority. There is enough money to do what is needed in an economy, but there is not enough money to do everything.”\n\nJala is also convinced that despite the progress of recent years, Malaysia’s is very much an unfinished journey. “There is still a long way to go — we are still learning the art of doing this and we must never say that we have reached the destination.”\n\n<em>The interview was written by Vincent Chin of the <a href=\"http://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Public Impact</a> (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/4publicimpact\" target=\"_blank\">@4publicimpact)</a>.</em>",

    "post_content": "The blizzard of statistics that Idris Jala has at his fingertips tells a story of rapid progress. Little wonder, then, that the walls of his office — located just below the prime minister’s — are adorned with numbers precisely specifying the targets and achievements of the government’s Transformation Programme since its launch in 2010.\n\nIdris Jala was appointed minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and chief executive of Malaysia’s Performance Management and Delivery Unit in 2009. He is responsible for leading the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) and the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), which underpin Malaysia’s efforts to become a developed, high-income nation by 2020.\n\n“It would be hard to find any country in the world that has been so clear about what it set out to do,” he says. “The problem with being so clear, though, is that it shows if we are unable to meet [our goals]. But every year we have an annual report and, if I look back over the past five years, I’m actually very impressed with the work that has been achieved against the targets that were set.”\n\nThe decision by the Prime Minister to launch these twin transformation programmes was prompted by the recognition that a step change in development was needed to safeguard Malaysia’s future prosperity. Although the twinkling lights of Kuala Lumpur’s Petronas Towers are a vivid example of the country’s economic prowess, segments of the country’s population remain excluded.\n\n<strong>The big picture</strong>\n\nThe GTP therefore aims to transform public-service delivery and ensure a high standard of living for all. The ETP is about enabling and unleashing greater private-sector initiative, with the government acting as a facilitator for the planned level of investments.\n\nJala stresses that inclusivity is a clear driver for the reforms. “When we said we wanted to create a new economic model, it couldn’t be something that only provides prosperity to a certain group of people. We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.”\n\n[blockquote] \"We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.” [/blockquote]\n\nSustainability is another focus, with much emphasis placed on avoiding the deep fiscal deficits that continue to plague other countries. “We have been able to reduce our fiscal deficit and have not missed our target in any of the last five years,” Jala says. “A lot of people were concerned about things like off-balance-sheet numbers and other liabilities, but even if these were included, we would still be performing better than many other countries.”\n\nSmall wonder, then, that the IMF recently paid tribute to Malaysia’s progress by lauding its “fiscal policy breakthrough” and the “important institutional innovation” that the country has undertaken.\n\nThe creation of a more balanced economy is crucial, he adds. “A sustainable fiscal position also includes reducing our dependency on oil and gas,” says Jala. “In 2009, oil and gas made up nearly 40% of government revenue. We were able to reduce this to 29 percent last year. How did we do this? We have enabled other sectors to grow. Our services sector, in particular, has grown substantially.” He adds that environmental progress has also been made, citing new investments in public transport and waste management as important, and continuing, priorities for the years ahead.\n\n<strong>How PEMANDU works</strong>\n\nBefore his government service, Jala enjoyed a long career in the private sector, establishing a reputation as someone who could turn around unprofitable businesses. After 21 years at Shell, he became managing director and CEO of Malaysia Airlines in 2005, where he turned a nine-month loss of $400 million into a record profit of $270 million in less than two years. The biggest difference between the public and private sectors, he says, lies in the financial statement. “In the private sector you have profit and loss, cash flow, and balance sheet — all anchor points to determine what constitutes success. In a country, though, it is very difficult, very nebulous — it can be anything you want — and that is why we spend a long time trying to identify what constitutes the measures of success, because if you don’t have this then you can’t prioritise.”\n\nJala’s emphasis on priorities is the key to the government’s new approach to transformation. “It is very important to have a programme — and I repeat the word ‘programme’,” he says. “In Malaysia and in many other countries, we have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes.”\n\nThe second ingredient is a budget. “A plan and a programme are just drafts until you have a budget and resources allocated to them,” he says. “So you should never print a plan that has no detailed budget. In the past, many governments have prepared beautiful plans but they were just drafts because they didn’t come with the requisite resources attached.”\n\n[blockquote] “We have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes” [/blockquote]\n\nThe twin foundations of programmes and budgets enable policymakers to identify their shared priorities, says Jala. “Most governments suffer from the problem of prioritisation. If you ask for their priorities and check how they allocate their resources, then they are often completely flawed. You can check their prioritisation by looking at their budget and whether or not their priorities are getting the lion’s share.”\n\nUnderpinning all of this is leadership alignment. “A cabinet can agree in the room,” he says, “but allocating resources to those priorities is when you find out if they do all really agree. It’s hard going because some ministries will lose resources, but this is when alignment becomes real.\n\nJala says that that this approach “absolutely” applies to private-sector organisations, and he and his government colleagues have adopted a number of different methods, from cabinet awaydays to public town halls, to ensure leadership alignment.\n\nThe awaydays, in particular, have proved very useful, he says. “Every year, we run these events. The prime minister and all the ministers sit down to take stock of where we have done well and where we haven’t. We also have an international panel review. We get people from the IMF and World Bank to come in and give us an outside-in view. We can then identify what we can do better. These meetings can be very brutal and honest and we mark the performance of each minister and ministry … from constructive criticism to commendations, and then we can see our priorities for next year and agree on the resources we need to deliver them.”\n\nIn addition to daily or weekly reviews, there is a semi-annual meeting of ministers, Jala, and the prime minister to check on progress. “And every month, a minister must chair a steering meeting that highlights the monthly achievements and problems,” Jala adds. “If the problems are not solved at the ministerial level, then they get escalated to the twice-yearly meetings chaired by the prime minister. If I lay all these together it shows how we have been able to move to implementation, rather than just having beautiful plans.”\n\nIt is clear that Jala believes prioritisation and budget to be pivotal to transformation as a whole. Many projects fail — not because of incompetence or bureaucracy — but rather from a lack of prioritisation, which can cause them to be poorly funded.\n\n<strong>What’s next?</strong>\n\nThe success of Malaysia’s transformation programme has increasingly attracted global attention. For example, 24 members of Jala’s team have been working in Tanzania to replicate the reforms and are seeing some impressive results.

Little wonder, then, that the walls of his office — located just below the prime minister’s — are adorned with numbers precisely specifying the targets and achievements of the government’s Transformation Programme since its launch in 2010.\n\nIdris Jala was appointed minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and chief executive of Malaysia’s Performance Management and Delivery Unit in 2009. He is responsible for leading the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) and the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), which underpin Malaysia’s efforts to become a developed, high-income nation by 2020.\n\n“It would be hard to find any country in the world that has been so clear about what it set out to do,” he says. “The problem with being so clear, though, is that it shows if we are unable to meet [our goals]. But every year we have an annual report and, if I look back over the past five years, I’m actually very impressed with the work that has been achieved against the targets that were set.”\n\nThe decision by the Prime Minister to launch these twin transformation programmes was prompted by the recognition that a step change in development was needed to safeguard Malaysia’s future prosperity. Although the twinkling lights of Kuala Lumpur’s Petronas Towers are a vivid example of the country’s economic prowess, segments of the country’s population remain excluded.\n\n<strong>The big picture</strong>\n\nThe GTP therefore aims to transform public-service delivery and ensure a high standard of living for all. The ETP is about enabling and unleashing greater private-sector initiative, with the government acting as a facilitator for the planned level of investments.\n\nJala stresses that inclusivity is a clear driver for the reforms. “When we said we wanted to create a new economic model, it couldn’t be something that only provides prosperity to a certain group of people. We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.”\n\n[blockquote] \"We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.” [/blockquote]\n\nSustainability is another focus, with much emphasis placed on avoiding the deep fiscal deficits that continue to plague other countries. “We have been able to reduce our fiscal deficit and have not missed our target in any of the last five years,” Jala says. “A lot of people were concerned about things like off-balance-sheet numbers and other liabilities, but even if these were included, we would still be performing better than many other countries.”\n\nSmall wonder, then, that the IMF recently paid tribute to Malaysia’s progress by lauding its “fiscal policy breakthrough” and the “important institutional innovation” that the country has undertaken.\n\nThe creation of a more balanced economy is crucial, he adds. “A sustainable fiscal position also includes reducing our dependency on oil and gas,” says Jala. “In 2009, oil and gas made up nearly 40% of government revenue. We were able to reduce this to 29 percent last year. How did we do this? We have enabled other sectors to grow. Our services sector, in particular, has grown substantially.” He adds that environmental progress has also been made, citing new investments in public transport and waste management as important, and continuing, priorities for the years ahead.\n\n<strong>How PEMANDU works</strong>\n\nBefore his government service, Jala enjoyed a long career in the private sector, establishing a reputation as someone who could turn around unprofitable businesses. After 21 years at Shell, he became managing director and CEO of Malaysia Airlines in 2005, where he turned a nine-month loss of $400 million into a record profit of $270 million in less than two years. The biggest difference between the public and private sectors, he says, lies in the financial statement. “In the private sector you have profit and loss, cash flow, and balance sheet — all anchor points to determine what constitutes success. In a country, though, it is very difficult, very nebulous — it can be anything you want — and that is why we spend a long time trying to identify what constitutes the measures of success, because if you don’t have this then you can’t prioritise.”\n\nJala’s emphasis on priorities is the key to the government’s new approach to transformation. “It is very important to have a programme — and I repeat the word ‘programme’,” he says. “In Malaysia and in many other countries, we have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes.”\n\nThe second ingredient is a budget. “A plan and a programme are just drafts until you have a budget and resources allocated to them,” he says. “So you should never print a plan that has no detailed budget. In the past, many governments have prepared beautiful plans but they were just drafts because they didn’t come with the requisite resources attached.”\n\n[blockquote] “We have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes” [/blockquote]\n\nThe twin foundations of programmes and budgets enable policymakers to identify their shared priorities, says Jala. “Most governments suffer from the problem of prioritisation. If you ask for their priorities and check how they allocate their resources, then they are often completely flawed. You can check their prioritisation by looking at their budget and whether or not their priorities are getting the lion’s share.”\n\nUnderpinning all of this is leadership alignment. “A cabinet can agree in the room,” he says, “but allocating resources to those priorities is when you find out if they do all really agree. It’s hard going because some ministries will lose resources, but this is when alignment becomes real.\n\nJala says that that this approach “absolutely” applies to private-sector organisations, and he and his government colleagues have adopted a number of different methods, from cabinet awaydays to public town halls, to ensure leadership alignment.\n\nThe awaydays, in particular, have proved very useful, he says. “Every year, we run these events. The prime minister and all the ministers sit down to take stock of where we have done well and where we haven’t. We also have an international panel review. We get people from the IMF and World Bank to come in and give us an outside-in view. We can then identify what we can do better. These meetings can be very brutal and honest and we mark the performance of each minister and ministry … from constructive criticism to commendations, and then we can see our priorities for next year and agree on the resources we need to deliver them.”\n\nIn addition to daily or weekly reviews, there is a semi-annual meeting of ministers, Jala, and the prime minister to check on progress. “And every month, a minister must chair a steering meeting that highlights the monthly achievements and problems,” Jala adds. “If the problems are not solved at the ministerial level, then they get escalated to the twice-yearly meetings chaired by the prime minister. If I lay all these together it shows how we have been able to move to implementation, rather than just having beautiful plans.”\n\nIt is clear that Jala believes prioritisation and budget to be pivotal to transformation as a whole. Many projects fail — not because of incompetence or bureaucracy — but rather from a lack of prioritisation, which can cause them to be poorly funded.\n\n<strong>What’s next?</strong>\n\nThe success of Malaysia’s transformation programme has increasingly attracted global attention. For example, 24 members of Jala’s team have been working in Tanzania to replicate the reforms and are seeing some impressive results. This suggests that the approach can be emulated in different countries. “If you had asked me when we first started if we could have achieved these results by this time, I would have said we probably couldn’t,” he reflects. “The credit goes to everyone who has been involved.”\n\nTo maintain the momentum, he says it is crucial to continue on this path and not be distracted. “We also need to get sharper and better prioritisation in allocation of resources. Life is full of trade-offs. Every government has to understand that it cannot do everything under the sun — you have to pick your battles and areas of priority. There is enough money to do what is needed in an economy, but there is not enough money to do everything.”\n\nJala is also convinced that despite the progress of recent years, Malaysia’s is very much an unfinished journey. “There is still a long way to go — we are still learning the art of doing this and we must never say that we have reached the destination.”\n\n<em>The interview was written by the <a href=\"http://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Public Impact</a> (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/4publicimpact\" target=\"_blank\">@4publicimpact)</a>.</em>",

    "post_content": "The blizzard of statistics that Idris Jala has at his fingertips tells a story of rapid progress. Little wonder, then, that the walls of his office — located just below the prime minister’s — are adorned with numbers precisely specifying the targets and achievements of the government’s Transformation Programme since its launch in 2010.\n\nIdris Jala was appointed minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and chief executive of Malaysia’s Performance Management and Delivery Unit in 2009. He is responsible for leading the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) and the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), which underpin Malaysia’s efforts to become a developed, high-income nation by 2020.\n\n“It would be hard to find any country in the world that has been so clear about what it set out to do,” he says. “The problem with being so clear, though, is that it shows if we are unable to meet [our goals]. But every year we have an annual report and, if I look back over the past five years, I’m actually very impressed with the work that has been achieved against the targets that were set.”\n\nThe decision by the Prime Minister to launch these twin transformation programmes was prompted by the recognition that a step change in development was needed to safeguard Malaysia’s future prosperity. Although the twinkling lights of Kuala Lumpur’s Petronas Towers are a vivid example of the country’s economic prowess, segments of the country’s population remain excluded.\n\n<strong>The big picture</strong>\n\nThe GTP therefore aims to transform public-service delivery and ensure a high standard of living for all. The ETP is about enabling and unleashing greater private-sector initiative, with the government acting as a facilitator for the planned level of investments.\n\nJala stresses that inclusivity is a clear driver for the reforms. “When we said we wanted to create a new economic model, it couldn’t be something that only provides prosperity to a certain group of people. We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.”\n\n[blockquote] \"We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.” [/blockquote]\n\nSustainability is another focus, with much emphasis placed on avoiding the deep fiscal deficits that continue to plague other countries. “We have been able to reduce our fiscal deficit and have not missed our target in any of the last five years,” Jala says. “A lot of people were concerned about things like off-balance-sheet numbers and other liabilities, but even if these were included, we would still be performing better than many other countries.”\n\nSmall wonder, then, that the IMF recently paid tribute to Malaysia’s progress by lauding its “fiscal policy breakthrough” and the “important institutional innovation” that the country has undertaken.\n\nThe creation of a more balanced economy is crucial, he adds. “A sustainable fiscal position also includes reducing our dependency on oil and gas,” says Jala. “In 2009, oil and gas made up nearly 40% of government revenue. We were able to reduce this to 29 percent last year. How did we do this? We have enabled other sectors to grow. Our services sector, in particular, has grown substantially.” He adds that environmental progress has also been made, citing new investments in public transport and waste management as important, and continuing, priorities for the years ahead.\n\n<strong>How PEMANDU works</strong>\n\nBefore his government service, Jala enjoyed a long career in the private sector, establishing a reputation as someone who could turn around unprofitable businesses. After 21 years at Shell, he became managing director and CEO of Malaysia Airlines in 2005, where he turned a nine-month loss of $400 million into a record profit of $270 million in less than two years. The biggest difference between the public and private sectors, he says, lies in the financial statement. “In the private sector you have profit and loss, cash flow, and balance sheet — all anchor points to determine what constitutes success. In a country, though, it is very difficult, very nebulous — it can be anything you want — and that is why we spend a long time trying to identify what constitutes the measures of success, because if you don’t have this then you can’t prioritise.”\n\nJala’s emphasis on priorities is the key to the government’s new approach to transformation. “It is very important to have a programme — and I repeat the word ‘programme’,” he says. “In Malaysia and in many other countries, we have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes.”\n\nThe second ingredient is a budget. “A plan and a programme are just drafts until you have a budget and resources allocated to them,” he says. “So you should never print a plan that has no detailed budget. In the past, many governments have prepared beautiful plans but they were just drafts because they didn’t come with the requisite resources attached.”\n\n[blockquote] “We have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes” [/blockquote]\n\nThe twin foundations of programmes and budgets enable policymakers to identify their shared priorities, says Jala. “Most governments suffer from the problem of prioritisation. If you ask for their priorities and check how they allocate their resources, then they are often completely flawed. You can check their prioritisation by looking at their budget and whether or not their priorities are getting the lion’s share.”\n\nUnderpinning all of this is leadership alignment. “A cabinet can agree in the room,” he says, “but allocating resources to those priorities is when you find out if they do all really agree. It’s hard going because some ministries will lose resources, but this is when alignment becomes real.\n\nJala says that that this approach “absolutely” applies to private-sector organisations, and he and his government colleagues have adopted a number of different methods, from cabinet awaydays to public town halls, to ensure leadership alignment.\n\nThe awaydays, in particular, have proved very useful, he says. “Every year, we run these events. The prime minister and all the ministers sit down to take stock of where we have done well and where we haven’t. We also have an international panel review. We get people from the IMF and World Bank to come in and give us an outside-in view. We can then identify what we can do better. These meetings can be very brutal and honest and we mark the performance of each minister and ministry … from constructive criticism to commendations, and then we can see our priorities for next year and agree on the resources we need to deliver them.”\n\nIn addition to daily or weekly reviews, there is a semi-annual meeting of ministers, Jala, and the prime minister to check on progress. “And every month, a minister must chair a steering meeting that highlights the monthly achievements and problems,” Jala adds. “If the problems are not solved at the ministerial level, then they get escalated to the twice-yearly meetings chaired by the prime minister. If I lay all these together it shows how we have been able to move to implementation, rather than just having beautiful plans.”\n\nIt is clear that Jala believes prioritisation and budget to be pivotal to transformation as a whole. Many projects fail — not because of incompetence or bureaucracy — but rather from a lack of prioritisation, which can cause them to be poorly funded.\n\n<strong>What’s next?</strong>\n\nThe success of Malaysia’s transformation programme has increasingly attracted global attention. For example, 24 members of Jala’s team have been working in Tanzania to replicate the reforms and are seeing some impressive results. This suggests that the approach can be emulated in different countries. “If you had asked me when we first started if we could have achieved these results by this time, I would have said we probably couldn’t,” he reflects. “The credit goes to everyone who has been involved.”\n\nTo maintain the momentum, he says it is crucial to continue on this path and not be distracted. “We also need to get sharper and better prioritisation in allocation of resources. Life is full of trade-offs. Every government has to understand that it cannot do everything under the sun — you have to pick your battles and areas of priority. There is enough money to do what is needed in an economy, but there is not enough money to do everything.”\n\nJala is also convinced that despite the progress of recent years, Malaysia’s is very much an unfinished journey. “There is still a long way to go — we are still learning the art of doing this and we must never say that we have reached the destination.”\n\n<em>The interview was written by the <a href=\"http://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Public Impact</a> (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/4publicimpact\" target=\"_blank\">@4publicimpact)</a>.</em>",

    "post_content": "Giving all students a baseline literacy in digital reading and mathematics will do more good than simply providing access to high-tech devices in schools, according to the OECD’s new digital literacy study (see full report below).\n\nStudents with limited access to computers performed better in the OECD’s PISA tests than those without any access at all, according to the results released last week. However, students scored worse in tests if they used computers very frequently, even after accounting for demographics and social background.\n\n“Ensuring that every child reaches a baseline level of proficiency in reading and mathematics will do more to create equal opportunities in a digital world than solely expanding or subsidising access to high-tech devices and services,” the OECD said.\n\nSingaporean students are the most digitally literate, according to the study of 31 countries and cities by the OECD. They are followed by students from Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada and Shanghai in the rankings.\n\n“To deliver on the promises technology holds, countries need to invest more effectively and ensure that teachers are at the forefront of designing and implementing this change,” said Andreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills.\n\nSchools and education ministries need to ensure both students and teachers have digital skills. They have to locate high-quality digital learning resources “from among a plethora of poor-quality ones”, the OECD said.\n\nICT is linked to better student performance only in certain contexts, such as when computer software and internet connections help to increase study time and practice, the OECD said. Teachers need to have clear learning goals of using technology and have to blend the technology into their lessons and curricula, it recommends.\n\n“If these challenges are not addressed as part of the technology plans of schools and education ministries, technology may do more harm than good to the teacher student interactions that underpin deep conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking,” the OECD said.\n\n<p style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Students, Computers and Learning: Making the Connection on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/282450715/Students-Computers-and-Learning-Making-the-Connection\">Students, Computers and Learning: Making the Connection</a></p>\n<iframe id=\"doc_8200\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/282450715/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;show_recommendations=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"undefined\"></iframe>",

    "post_content": "Giving all students a baseline literacy in digital reading and mathematics will do more good than simply providing access to high-tech devices in schools, according to the OECD’s new digital literacy study (see full report below).\n\nStudents with limited access to computers performed better in the OECD’s PISA tests than those without any access at all, according to the results released last week. However, students scored worse in tests if they used computers very frequently, even after accounting for demographics and social background.\n\n“Ensuring that every child reaches a baseline level of proficiency in reading and mathematics will do more to create equal opportunities in a digital world than solely expanding or subsidising access to high-tech devices and services,” the OECD said.\n\nSingaporean students are the most digitally literate, according to the study of 31 countries and cities by the OECD. They are followed by students from Korea, Hong Kong, Japan, Canada and Shanghai in the rankings.\n\n“To deliver on the promises technology holds, countries need to invest more effectively and ensure that teachers are at the forefront of designing and implementing this change,” said Andreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills.\n\nSchools and education ministries need to ensure both students and teachers have digital skills. They have to locate high-quality digital learning resources “from among a plethora of poor-quality ones”, the OECD said.\n\nICT is linked to better student performance only in certain contexts, such as when computer software and internet connections help to increase study time and practice, the OECD said. Teachers need to have clear learning goals of using technology and have to blend the technology into their lessons and curricula, it recommends.\n\n“If these challenges are not addressed as part of the technology plans of schools and education ministries, technology may do more harm than good to the teacher student interactions that underpin deep conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking,” the OECD said.\n<p style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;\"><a style=\"text-decoration: underline;\" title=\"View Students, Computers and Learning: Making the Connection on Scribd\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/doc/282450715/Students-Computers-and-Learning-Making-the-Connection\">Students, Computers and Learning: Making the Connection</a></p>\n<iframe id=\"doc_8200\" class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/282450715/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;show_recommendations=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"undefined\"></iframe>",

    "post_content": "Mark Twain famously said that “a lie can get halfway around the world while the truth is putting its boots on”. The spread of false information can be a huge problem for government, but social media engagement can help.\n\nThis was seen recently in Singapore, where rumours spread that the government was cloud seeding to protect its hosting of the Formula 1.\n\nSingapore Government strenuously denied the claims, including through the traditional local media, but that didn’t stop the story getting traction. So Environment Minister Vivian Balakrishnan took to social media to spread the word.\n\nPosting on Facebook, he showed a photograph of a message warning people to stay inside due to imminent cloud seeding operations.\n\nUnderneath, he repeated the government’s denial of this.\n<div id=\"fb-root\" class=\" fb_reset\"></div>\n<div></div>\n<div class=\"fb-post fb_iframe_widget\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Vivian.Balakrishnan.Sg/posts/10153001649111207:0\" data-width=\"500\"><span style=\"vertical-align: bottom; width: 500px; height: 762px;\"><iframe class=\"\" style=\"border: none; visibility: visible; width: 500px; height: 762px;\" title=\"fb:post Facebook Social Plugin\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/v2.3/plugins/post.php?app_id=&amp;channel=https%3A%2F%2Fs-static.ak.facebook.com%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter%2F6brUqVNoWO3.js%3Fversion%3D41%23cb%3Df22aeee45c%26domain%3Dgovinsider.asia%26origin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgovinsider.asia%252Ff3d35475c%26relation%3Dparent.parent&amp;container_width=919&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FVivian.Balakrishnan.Sg%2Fposts%2F10153001649111207%3A0&amp;locale=en_GB&amp;sdk=joey&amp;width=500\" name=\"f39ba8d9e4\" width=\"500px\" height=\"1000px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></span></div>\nThat helped, but more interesting was his engagement in the comments sections. Here, you can see the Minister actively persuading someone, who changes his mind about cloud seeding.\n\n<a href=\"https://govinsider.asia/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/balakrishnan.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-214 size-full\" src=\"https://govinsider.asia/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/balakrishnan.jpg\" alt=\"balakrishnan\" width=\"872\" height=\"467\" /></a>\n\nSocial media has useful analytics to demonstrate the impact of the campaign. The Facebook post received 2,833 likes and 2,717 shares – likely reaching thousands more readers.\n\nThe post was free; took minutes; and made a measureable impact. Surely this is the future of public engagement.",

    "post_content": "The blizzard of statistics that Idris Jala has at his fingertips tells a story of rapid progress. Little wonder, then, that the walls of his office — located just below the prime minister’s — are adorned with numbers precisely specifying the targets and achievements of the government’s Transformation Programme since its launch in 2010.\n\nIdris Jala was appointed minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and chief executive of Malaysia’s Performance Management and Delivery Unit in 2009. He is responsible for leading the Government Transformation Programme (GTP) and the Economic Transformation Programme (ETP), which underpin Malaysia’s efforts to become a developed, high-income nation by 2020.\n\n“It would be hard to find any country in the world that has been so clear about what it set out to do,” he says. “The problem with being so clear, though, is that it shows if we are unable to meet [our goals]. But every year we have an annual report and, if I look back over the past five years, I’m actually very impressed with the work that has been achieved against the targets that were set.”\n\nThe decision by the Prime Minister to launch these twin transformation programmes was prompted by the recognition that a step change in development was needed to safeguard Malaysia’s future prosperity. Although the twinkling lights of Kuala Lumpur’s Petronas Towers are a vivid example of the country’s economic prowess, segments of the country’s population remain excluded.\n\n<strong>The big picture</strong>\n\nThe GTP therefore aims to transform public-service delivery and ensure a high standard of living for all. The ETP is about enabling and unleashing greater private-sector initiative, with the government acting as a facilitator for the planned level of investments.\n\nJala stresses that inclusivity is a clear driver for the reforms. “When we said we wanted to create a new economic model, it couldn’t be something that only provides prosperity to a certain group of people. We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.”\n\n[blockquote] \"We want to include low-income households and rural people, and we are also now doing a lot more for women as well.” [/blockquote]\n\nSustainability is another focus, with much emphasis placed on avoiding the deep fiscal deficits that continue to plague other countries. “We have been able to reduce our fiscal deficit and have not missed our target in any of the last five years,” Jala says. “A lot of people were concerned about things like off-balance-sheet numbers and other liabilities, but even if these were included, we would still be performing better than many other countries.”\n\nSmall wonder, then, that the IMF recently paid tribute to Malaysia’s progress by lauding its “fiscal policy breakthrough” and the “important institutional innovation” that the country has undertaken.\n\nThe creation of a more balanced economy is crucial, he adds. “A sustainable fiscal position also includes reducing our dependency on oil and gas,” says Jala. “In 2009, oil and gas made up nearly 40% of government revenue. We were able to reduce this to 29 percent last year. How did we do this? We have enabled other sectors to grow. Our services sector, in particular, has grown substantially.” He adds that environmental progress has also been made, citing new investments in public transport and waste management as important, and continuing, priorities for the years ahead.\n\n<strong>How PEMANDU works</strong>\n\nBefore his government service, Jala enjoyed a long career in the private sector, establishing a reputation as someone who could turn around unprofitable businesses. After 21 years at Shell, he became managing director and CEO of Malaysia Airlines in 2005, where he turned a nine-month loss of $400 million into a record profit of $270 million in less than two years. The biggest difference between the public and private sectors, he says, lies in the financial statement. “In the private sector you have profit and loss, cash flow, and balance sheet — all anchor points to determine what constitutes success. In a country, though, it is very difficult, very nebulous — it can be anything you want — and that is why we spend a long time trying to identify what constitutes the measures of success, because if you don’t have this then you can’t prioritise.”\n\nJala’s emphasis on priorities is the key to the government’s new approach to transformation. “It is very important to have a programme — and I repeat the word ‘programme’,” he says. “In Malaysia and in many other countries, we have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes.”\n\nThe second ingredient is a budget. “A plan and a programme are just drafts until you have a budget and resources allocated to them,” he says. “So you should never print a plan that has no detailed budget. In the past, many governments have prepared beautiful plans but they were just drafts because they didn’t come with the requisite resources attached.”\n\n[blockquote] “We have had beautiful documents and strategic plans, but implementation is about programmes” [/blockquote]\n\nThe twin foundations of programmes and budgets enable policymakers to identify their shared priorities, says Jala. “Most governments suffer from the problem of prioritisation. If you ask for their priorities and check how they allocate their resources, then they are often completely flawed. You can check their prioritisation by looking at their budget and whether or not their priorities are getting the lion’s share.”\n\nUnderpinning all of this is leadership alignment. “A cabinet can agree in the room,” he says, “but allocating resources to those priorities is when you find out if they do all really agree. It’s hard going because some ministries will lose resources, but this is when alignment becomes real.\n\nJala says that that this approach “absolutely” applies to private-sector organisations, and he and his government colleagues have adopted a number of different methods, from cabinet awaydays to public town halls, to ensure leadership alignment.\n\nThe awaydays, in particular, have proved very useful, he says. “Every year, we run these events. The prime minister and all the ministers sit down to take stock of where we have done well and where we haven’t. We also have an international panel review. We get people from the IMF and World Bank to come in and give us an outside-in view. We can then identify what we can do better. These meetings can be very brutal and honest and we mark the performance of each minister and ministry … from constructive criticism to commendations, and then we can see our priorities for next year and agree on the resources we need to deliver them.”\n\nIn addition to daily or weekly reviews, there is a semi-annual meeting of ministers, Jala, and the prime minister to check on progress. “And every month, a minister must chair a steering meeting that highlights the monthly achievements and problems,” Jala adds. “If the problems are not solved at the ministerial level, then they get escalated to the twice-yearly meetings chaired by the prime minister. If I lay all these together it shows how we have been able to move to implementation, rather than just having beautiful plans.”\n\nIt is clear that Jala believes prioritisation and budget to be pivotal to transformation as a whole. Many projects fail — not because of incompetence or bureaucracy — but rather from a lack of prioritisation, which can cause them to be poorly funded.\n\n<strong>What’s next?</strong>\n\nThe success of Malaysia’s transformation programme has increasingly attracted global attention. For example, 24 members of Jala’s team have been working in Tanzania to replicate the reforms and are seeing some impressive results. This suggests that the approach can be emulated in different countries. “If you had asked me when we first started if we could have achieved these results by this time, I would have said we probably couldn’t,” he reflects. “The credit goes to everyone who has been involved.”\n\nTo maintain the momentum, he says it is crucial to continue on this path and not be distracted. “We also need to get sharper and better prioritisation in allocation of resources. Life is full of trade-offs. Every government has to understand that it cannot do everything under the sun — you have to pick your battles and areas of priority. There is enough money to do what is needed in an economy, but there is not enough money to do everything.”\n\nJala is also convinced that despite the progress of recent years, Malaysia’s is very much an unfinished journey. “There is still a long way to go — we are still learning the art of doing this and we must never say that we have reached the destination.”\n\n<em>The interview was written by the <a href=\"http://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Centre for Public Impact</a> (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/4publicimpact\" target=\"_blank\">@4publicimpact)</a>,</em><em> a not for profit foundation dedicated to improving the positive impact of governments.</em>\n\n<em> </em>",

The <a href=\"http://beta.data.gov.sg/blog/fingerprint-of-a-bus-route\" target=\"_blank\">first post</a> is already up and is about how data and visualisations are used to understand demands for public buses (see image below).\n\n<a href=\"https://govinsider.asia/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bus-routes-visualisation.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-277\" src=\"https://govinsider.asia/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Bus-routes-visualisation.jpg\" alt=\"Visualisation of bus route data on beta.data.gov.sg\"/></a>\n\nThe website also allows users to preview the datasets without having to download them “to make data more accessible”, data.gov.sg’s blog post said.\n\n“We are also working on improving the quality of our datasets, and to <a style=\"color:#000;text-decoration:none\" href=\"http://cococheats.com/episode-choose-your-story-hack/\">free tickets episode</a>  provide new ones that are relevant to all citizens,” it added.\n\nAs the team tests the beta website, it wants to hear citizens’ feedback. “Send us your comments at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@data.gov.sg\">feedback@data.gov.sg</a>,” it wrote.\n\nThe beta website is available at <a href=\"http://beta.data.gov.sg/\" target=\"_blank\">beta.data.gov.sg</a>.",

The first post is already up and is about how data and visualisations are used to understand demands for public buses.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe website also allows users to preview the datasets without having to download them “to make data more accessible”, data.gov.sg’s blog post said.\n\n“We are also working on improving the quality of our datasets, and to provide new ones that are relevant to all citizens,” it added.\n\nAs the team tests the beta website, it wants to hear citizens’ feedback. “Send us your comments at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@data.gov.sg\">feedback@data.gov.sg</a>,” it wrote.\n\nThe beta website is available at <a href=\"http://beta.data.gov.sg/\" target=\"_blank\">beta.data.gov.sg</a>.",

To ensure continued economic growth, Singapore is looking to more automation and ensure citizens update their skills.\n\nGovInsider has plotted the Ministry of Manpower’s latest data on labour productivity to illustrate this problem.\n\nLabour productivity fell by 0.5% in the first half of this year, after 9 months of decline in 2014. In the first of 2014, productivity fell by 0.4%, and in the second half by 1.2%. “Overall productivity growth is not likely to see a significant uplift this year,” the Ministry of Manpower said on 15 September.\n\nAs a result, Singapore has two options: it could either hire more immigrants, or automate tasks. As Singapore intends to continue reducing the number of foreigners in its workforce, the government is looking to automation.\n\nRestaurants are using drones to replace waiters and robots to cook. Researchers have built a robot that can tile floors two to three times faster than humans. The government is using robotics to dispense medicines in hospitals and is testing whether driverless vehicles can be used for public transport.\n\nThe government has also launched a skills drive to encourage citizens to upgrade their skills. The SkillsFuture programme gives very Singapore 25 years old and above S$500 to attend training sessions. Companies will also need to make “significant investments in developing their employees and rewarding them based on their skills and contributions,” the Ministry of Manpower added.",
